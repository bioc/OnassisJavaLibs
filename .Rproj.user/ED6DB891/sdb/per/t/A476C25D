It is also possible to annotate genes, histone marks and histone modifications.\n\nThe semantic similarity module uses different semantic similarity measures to determine the semantic similarity of concepts in a given ontology, groups of concepts or experiments and samples annotated with ontology terms. \nThis step is particularly useful for a better retrieval of data of interest from public repositories such as GEO http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ or SRA http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra. \nThe semantic similarity module has been developed on the basis of the Java slib http://www.semantic-measures-library.org/sml.\nTo run Onassis Java (>= 1.8) is needed. \n",
