In order to have a jar file including all the needed dependencies, the source code avaiable in the GitHub repository https://github.com/UCDenver-ccp/ccp-nlp, version 3.3.2 has been compiled using maven with the following goals:\n/code{ mvn clean compile assembly:single  -Dlog4j.configuration=log4j2.properties}\nThe methods for computing the semantic similarities instead have been developed and published by the the Ecole des mines d'Al√®s under the GPL-compatible CeCILL licence. In this case the source code available in the GitHub repository https://github.com/sharispe/slib, version 0.9.5, has been downloaded and modified in some parts to load OBO ontologies without generating an exception if a namespace is not provided. In particular, in the new version of the library the following files have been modified:\n<ul>\n<li> GraphLoader_OBO_1_2.java to add the namespace when the OBO file is loaded in a graph </li>\n<li> SMConstants.java to add more short flags to the SIM_PAIRWISE_SHORT_FLAGS </li>\n<li> pom.xml in the main slib directory to change the version of the modified library\n</ul>\n\nTo install the library in the local repository the following command has been run from the slib directory where the pom.xml of the parent project is located:\n/code{ mvn clean install }\n\nA Similarity.java class has been created to compute load OBO ontologies into a graph, to configure the similarity measure and to compute the semantic similarity between two concepts (pairwise similarity) or two sets of concepts (groupwise similarity)\n\nTo create a unique jar with all the dependencies we used maven as follows:\n/code{mvn clean install  assembly:single}\nThis two libraries will be used in the package Onassis\n}\n",
