def: "A cell that is found in a natural setting, which includes multicellular organism cells 'in vivo' (i.e. part of an organism), and unicellular organisms 'in environment' (i.e. part of a natural environment)." [CARO:mah]
comment: To accommodate unicellular organisms better, 'cell in vivo' has been re-labeled 'native cell' to better represent its intended meaning - that is, that it is a cell in the context of a multicellular organism or in a natural environment. 'Native' is intended to contrast with 'in vitro', which refers to cells or other biological entities that have been intentionally placed in a controlled, non-natural setting for the purpose of study or manipulation. (MAH 1.12.12).

def: "Any of the immature or mature forms of a granular leukocyte with a nucleus that usually has two lobes connected by one or more slender threads of chromatin, and cytoplasm containing coarse, round granules that are uniform in size and which can be stained by the dye eosin. Eosinophils are CD9-positive, CD191-positive, and CD193-positive." [GOC:add, GOC:amm, GOC:dsd, GOC:tfm, ISBN:0721601464, PMCID:PMC2626675, PMID:10914487, PMID:1662676]

The cytokines IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF are involved in their development and differentiation. Usually considered CD16-negative, CD16 is observed on eosinophilic metamyelocyte.
